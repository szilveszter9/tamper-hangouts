# tamper-hangouts
Add some bottom margin to google hangouts boxes

# setup
Unfortunately Tampermonkey's documentation and it's interface is not really user friendly, so I add some help here:
* add https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo to your chrome/~ium
* click on Tampermonkey's icon in the extensions bar (black square with two dots in it)
* select Dashboard
* click on new script (tab) icon (you can find it right next to 'Installed script')
* replace the default template with the content of the given javascript
* save the script (floppy icon or <ctrl>+s or <cmd>+s)
* reload your hangouts
* you should see that extension icon has a small red square with a number in it
